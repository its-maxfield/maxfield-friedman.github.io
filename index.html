  bio:"I should probably tell you a bit about me. I’ve loved games and puzzles since before I even realized “oh, this is my thing.” When you’re a kid with the self-awareness of a potato, you don’t exactly connect the dots between “I like this” and “this might be my entire life trajectory.” I got into this field for all the wrong reasons at first: I like puzzles, I play games, and if I’m gaming instead of studying for my game-dev exam… isn’t that technically studying? Eventually, I figured out the real reason I’m here: I love solving hard problems and turning them into experiences that actually mean something to people. These days I work in XR and real-time systems—building interactive stuff in Unity and Unreal that can teach, train, entertain, or let someone forget about the world for a little while. If I can make something that helps someone learn, smile, feel a bit braver, or connect with someone else (even through a headset), I’m in. Yes, I’m still early in my career. No, I’m not lacking in effort. I will absolutely work my ass off for you, your team, or whatever weird idea you think might be “too ambitious” for a portfolio project. Scroll through the rest of the site, check out what I’ve built, and if anything sparks an idea—or you just want to talk games, VR, running, or building cool systems—reach out. And if you happen to have a job while you’re at it… I definitely won’t be mad about that.",

I’ve seen so much crossover into other aspects of my life that this has become less of a hobby and more of a routine.

I've spent many years combined working in restaurants as well, from dishwasher to server and most positions in the front and back of the house. Both cooking and baking are creative outlets that thrive off experimentation and iteration. They're hard to master and when you get it right, immensely rewarding in flavor. What really keeps this hobby going is what it does for those around me. Food breeds community. People love a good meal. I love making things for others. It really is a win-win. Everyone should do it and everyone can 100% learn to do it!",
